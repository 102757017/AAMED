# Arc Adjacency Matrix based Fast Ellipse Detection

We proposed a fast ellipse detection method based on arc adjacency matrix. We have successfully used this method in some applications, such as satellite tracking, UGV guidance and pose estimation.

## 1 Compile our Codes

We have successfully applied AAMED to various platforms (Windows, Ubuntu, ARM). The codes used for different platforms may require some minor changes.

### 1.1 Windows

- OpenCV >  3.1.0
- VS 2015

You can add all .h and .cpp files into your project. Don't forget to config your project about OpenCV :). 

main.cpp has given an example to detect ellipses from an image.

**AAMED aamed(drows, dcols)**. drows (dcols) must be larger than the rows (cols) of all used images. Then, we can use **aamed.run_FLED(imgG);** to detect ellipses from multiple images.


### 1.2 Python

**Install**
In setup.py, you need to config `opencv_include, opencv_lib_dirs, libraries` correctly about OpenCV. Then, 

	cd python
    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

**Test**

    python test_aamed.py


## 2 Label Tool

we provide a tool to label ellipses (circles) from an image. This tool is based on MATLAB R2016. First, you need to run `setup.m` to compile **mexElliFit**. Then, you can run `main.m` to use this label tool.

</div>


## 3 AAMED Viewer
we proivide a tool to show critical data (edge contours, DP contours, arc contours, AAM and detected ellipses) in MATLAB. We use this tool to find bugs of AAMED and test functions.

You need to run `setup.m` to compile **mexcvtBasicData, mexcvtRRect, mexcvtVVP, mexcvtAAM**. Then you can use `main.m` to read `DetailAAMED.aamed`.

## 4 Nine Datasets

We have uploaded 9 datasets used in our paper to [Baidu Cloud (Code: 7br2)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vUx7d3mvRxIPGSwi8DLADg)  and [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Af32acr4g9-4EvbAVMHS7fKVnD-XrDeM/view?usp=sharing).

## 5 Measure Tool

We have provided a tool that can be used to measure our method. Firstly, you need to run `setup.m` in *measuretool/MeasureTools* to build the mex files. Then, `MeasureAllDatasets.m` needs to be configured as described below. Finally, you can run `MeasureAllDatasets.m` to measure the used method.

- **data_root_path**: The root path of all datasets.
- **dataset_name**: The file names of used datasets. *dataset_name* is an array of *cell*, each element in it is a string that represents the dataset file name.
- **gt_label** contains the labels of corresponding datasets. `Read_Ellipse_GT.m` uses these labels to  load ground-truth.
- **methods_name** is the file name that stores the results of used method. 
- **method_label** is the label of corresponding method. `Read_Ellipse_Results.m` uses this label to load detection results.

The sample output of `MeasureAllDatasets.m` is as following.

	Evaluating dataset: Satellite Images - Dataset Meng #2
	Precision: 80.9524%,  Recall: 85%,  F-measure: 82.9268%. 
	Average detected time: 2.6065 ms.


## 6 How to Make your Datasets

The format of ellipse dataset is as follows.
<div align="center">
  <img src="measuretool/dsformat.jpg" width="400px" />
</div>

If you want to make a new dataset, you can put the collected images into the file **images**. Then, the ground-truth files that are generated by labeltool can be put into the file **gt**. Finally, you need to create the file **imagenames.txt** that contains all image names.
